# CS-370
This intelligent agent was created by me in code given by CS-370 course. I have created and implemented Q-learning algorithms for the agent based on reinforcement learning.
Computer Scientists design and develop hardware and/or software to solve real life problems with wide variety of existing technologies. They want to solve problems and implement efficient way to do it.
As computer scientist, I would approach problem from different set of angles and design a method to solve it.

My ethical responsibilities are:

To keep end user and organization's data safe and secure.

Keep data only on-need basis and remove permanently after usage is complete.

Design and develop software applications per user's requirements in safe and stable way.
